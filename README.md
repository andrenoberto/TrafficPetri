# TrafficPetri
A Petri Net made using CPN Tools that simulates the communication between two traffic lights.

## CPN Tools

It uses CPN Tools to simulate our colored petri net.

You can download CPN Tools on it's [website][cpnwebsite].

To simulate, simply run the .cpn file and start the simulation.

## Java Project

There's also an in progress Java project that will make a communication with CPN Tools' server and will be able to show the simulation within a better GUI.

You can find the source code inside JavaPetri folder.

## Instructions

### First step

Run `JavaPetri.jar`

### Second step

Open `trafficlights.cpn` & start the simulation.

If everything is fine, the application will begin to sync it's traffic lights with the ones inside CPNTools.

Now you should see the application and CPNTools interacting.
